<hr />

<p>With 2023 drawing to a close, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on some highlights.</p>

<h2 id="1-joining-the-kubernetes-release-team">1. Joining the Kubernetes release team</h2>

<p>I first joined the enhancements team for the 1.27 release and wasnâ€™t sure what to expect. It ended up being a great experience and introduction to the open source Kubernetes community. I enjoyed it so much I came back for the 1.28 and 1.29 release teams!</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about the release team is the creative release logo that get designed for each Kubernetes release. Iâ€™ve now been a part of 1.27, 1.28 and 1.29 and here are the logos of all the releases Iâ€™ve been a part of in 2023:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.27/logo/127-logo.png?raw=true" width="400" />

<h2 id="2-kubecon-eu-in-amsterdam">2. Kubecon EU in Amsterdam</h2>

<p>Aaron Birkland and I got our talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xCsMfPVZ6M">Developing a Mental Model of Istio: From Kubernetes to Sidecars to Ambient</a> accepted at Kubecon EU!</p>

<p>We compared Istio policies for a sidecar set versus an Ambient setup to illustrate some of the subtle differences in two setups. It was a litttttle nerve racking making sure our live demo worked in front of all those people. Luckily I scripted everything before hand and if youâ€™re curious about the scenarios I made them publicly available along with my demo script on <a href="https://github.com/npolshakova/ambient-examples">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the 1.27 release team, I was attended the <a href="https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2023/kcseu/">Contributer Summit</a>. Every year, just before the official start of KubeCon+CloudNativeCon, thereâ€™s a special meetup that is open to all members of one of the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md">Kubernetes orgs</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/11/03/k8s-contributor-summit-behind-the-scenes/kcseu2023-group.jpg" alt="Can you find me in the crowd?" /></p>

<h2 id="3-enhancements-lead-for-129">3. Enhancements Lead for 1.29</h2>

<p>As part of being a release lead for enhancements, I got to present at the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/online-programs/cncf-live-webinar-kubernetes-1-29-release/">CNCF 1.29 release webinar</a> with Priyanka Saggu and Carol Valencia! There were many exciting new features graduating in 1.29, but these were some of the highlights I was very happy to see graduate:</p>

<h3 id="-sidecar-containers-are-finally-a-thing-">ðŸŽ‰ Sidecar containers are (finally) a thing ðŸŽ‰</h3>

<p>SidecarContainers have been a long awaited feature which graduated to beta and is now enabled by default starting 1.29. I think this is the most popular Github issue in both the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3761">enhancements repo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/25908">kubernetes repo</a>.</p>

<p>SidecarContainers are a new type of containers that start among the Init containers, run through the lifecycle of the Pod and donâ€™t block pod termination. Kubelet makes a best effort to keep them alive and running while other containers are running.</p>

<p>This is particularly nice for service meshes following the sidecar pattern, such as Istio. John Howard wrote a <a href="https://istio.io/latest/blog/2023/native-sidecars/">great Istio blog</a> testing out the kubernetes native sidecar feature with Istio when sidecars graduated into alpha in 1.28.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re curious, you can read more on the enhancement issue for <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/753">KEP-753: Sidecar Containers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="nftables-are-coming">NFTables are coming</h3>

<p>The nftables API is the successor to the iptables API, and although it is designed to provide better performance and scalability than iptables, the kube-proxy nftables mode is still under heavy development as of v1.29 and is not necessarily expected to outperform the other Linux modes. Itâ€™s also only currently available on linux nodes.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re curious, you can read more on the enhancement issue for <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3866">KEP-3866: nftables kube-proxy backend</a>.</p>

<h3 id="in-place-updates-of-pod-resources">In-place updates of pod resources</h3>

<p>Currently changes to resource allocation such as cpu/memory require you to recreate the Pod. Thatâ€™s not something we need/want to do in a lot of cases. For example, if the load on a Pod increases significantly and the current resources are not sufficient, we donâ€™t necessarily want to kill the pod and restart- we just want to give more resources. This change make PodSpec containers mutable which unlocks vertical autoscaling as a usecase.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/609/674/369.gif" /></p>

<p>Some historical context- this feature ended up staying in alpha for 1.29, but has been a long awaited feature in the community. Discussions  around it started during 1.17 in 2019 and there have been github issues open since 2015 (<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/9043">#9043</a>)!! So yeah, this one has been in the works for a whileâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="4-kubecon-na-in-chicago">4. Kubecon NA in Chicago</h2>

<p>Marino Wijay and I has a talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtS6NBobtnc">Pi in the Sky: Onboarding Edge Workloads Into the Service Mesh</a> accepted to Kubernetes on EDGE Day. We ran Istio ambient on a Raspberry Pi (thank goodness for ARM builds!) and Istio on a local kind cluster on the same network, then showed off some fancy Istio magic with routing and AuthorizationPolicies.</p>

<p>Hardware live demos are always fun because there are even more things that can go wrong. Butâ€¦ Marino and I had run through the scenarios so many times, I knew how to live debug our setup when the ztunnel on the Raspberry Pi wasnâ€™t getting any updates from our cluster (it turned out to be a pesky missing iptable route). Along the way, we had a lot of fun prepping different scenarios to show (and ended up having to cut a couple for the demo to fit everything in).</p>

<p>In Chicago, I also attended the Contributer Summit again and got to meet some of the release team members in person!
