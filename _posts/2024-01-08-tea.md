I love tea... It's not only my prefered source of caffine, it's also a good excuse to have tiny sandwiches and pastries like this excessive high tea I had at the Delft Blue Museum:

Maybe because of my tea addiction, one of my favorite "easter eggs" in networking is the 418 status code. The teapot from earlier was actually from Google's [teapot page](https://www.google.com/teapot). If you curl it with the `-v` (verbose) flag you'll actually get (a very secure) `418` response back: 

```

If you keep digging down this teapot rabbit hole, there's also an http version of the teapot page (`http://www.google.com/teapot`) that you can hit as well. However this still uses HTTP/1.1 so you'll get a slightly different response back: 

```
❯ curl http://www.google.com/teapot -v
* Host www.google.com:80 was resolved.
* IPv6: 2607:f8b0:4005:814::2004
* IPv4: 142.251.46.164

* Connected to www.google.com (2607:f8b0:4005:814::2004) port 80
> GET /teapot HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.google.com
> User-Agent: curl/8.5.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 418 I'm a Teapot
```

The same behavior happens when you hit `http://httpbin.org/status/418` vs `http://httpbin.org/status/418` except you get a cute ascii teapot in the response body:

```
❯ curl http://httpbin.org/status/418 -v
* Host httpbin.org:80 was resolved.
* IPv6: (none)
* IPv4: 44.197.233.190, 3.224.157.95, 184.73.216.86, 52.206.94.89
*   Trying 44.197.233.190:80...
* Connected to httpbin.org (44.197.233.190) port 80

```

One thing you might notice is the text in the HTTP/1.1 protocols is slightly different (Google's calm, adult "I'm a Teapot" vs. httpbin's aggressive "I'M A TEAPOT"). The reason for this different is you can actually set the [available http status codes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml) to whatever you want in HTTP/1.1. However in HTTP/2.2 the 418 status code is now dedicated as [unused](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-15.5.19) but not assignable since so many people have been using the 418 for testing and it exists else where in the wild (See the [Save 418 Movement](https://save418.com/)). 

So how what does 418 have to do with teapots? Backstory time... 

The HTTP `418: I'm a teapot` client error response code comes from an April Fool's joke. In 1998, [RFC 2324](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2324) defined a communication protocol called Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0) designed for "controlling, monitoring and diagnosing coffee pots". Logically any attempt to brew coffee with a teapot should result in the error code "418 I'm a teapot". There have even been implementations of the HTCPC protocol such as http://error418.net/ (although they intentionally use a teapot and raspberry pi instead of a coffee pot to highlight the 418 response). 

Well, back in October 2023, Marino Wijay and I had some fun hacking with Istio and Raspberry Pis as part of Kubecon NA's colocated event, Kubernetes on Edge Day. Our talk was aptly titled [Pi in the Sky: Onboarding Edge Workloads Into the Service Mesh!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtS6NBobtnc) and we onboarded a bare-metal Raspberry Pi into the Istio mesh by running the ambient ztunnel directly on the Pi. 

We only had thirty minutes to give our lightning talk so some of our demo needed to be cut. One of those demos was our mTLS secured teapot onboarded onto the mesh. 

As part of our demo, we use a [MSNSwitch](https://msnswitch.com/) to control outlets remotely. This part was honestly a little hacky because I ended up not being able to get the secure requests to work over the MSNSwitch apis, so I ended up having to inspect the MSNSwitch source code to figure out how requests on the admin panel were being made. Then I scrapped the cookie from the login page and made the call directly with the cookie in the header like you see on the GitHub [source code](https://github.com/npolshakova/KubeconDemos/blob/main/msn_switch_server/switch_app.py#L22). 

Then I wrapped all of the MSNSwitch APIs with a simple Flask webserver. I ran the server on the Raspberry Pi that was connected to the MSNSwitch:

```bash 
sudo python3 ./msn_switch_server/switch_app.py 
```

This has serveral paths:
``` 
switchOne/on
switchOne/off 
switchOne/toggle
switchTwo/on
switchTwo/off 
switchTwo/toggle
```

This will run on port `80` and will be reachable via: 

``` 
http://<raspberry-pi>:80/switchTwo/on
```

On the cluster side, I needed to create a Kubernetes service that we could use to apply Istio policies to: 

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: teapot-pi
  namespace: pi-namespace
  labels:
    app: teapot-pi
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: http-pi
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: "${PI_APP}"
EOF
```

Now for the fun Istio part- we want to define the `418` status code without implementing HTCPCP. Istio's [VirtualServices](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/) defines a set of traffic routing rules and configuration to apply when a host is addressed. One of the configurations a user can make is adding [HTTPFaultInjection](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/#HTTPFaultInjection) to test the resiliency of a system to certain failure codes. 

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: teapot-app-fault-injection
  namespace: pi-namespace
spec:
  exportTo: 
  - "*"
  hosts:
  - teapot-pi
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        tea-drinker:
          exact: nina
    headers:
     response:
      add:
       test: "I'm a teapot!"
    fault:
     abort:
        httpStatus: 418
        percentage:
          value: 100
    route:
    - destination:
        host: teapot-pi
        port:
          number: 80
```

In this example we'll also add some [header manipulation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/#Headers) to injection a simple "test: I'm a teapot!" header. Both the header manipulation and fault injection is only triggered when the `tea-drinker: nina` header is provided. All other requests will go through as expected. 

I applied this policy with `kubectl apply` in the namespace the Kubernetes service is defined in. 

Finally I could curl with this and turn on the teapot:
```bash 
curl teapot-pi.pi-namespace:80/switchTwo/on
```

However, adding the `-H "tea-drinker: nina"` header results in a fault injection with the `418` status:

```
curl -H "tea-drinker: nina" teapot-pi.pi-namespace:80/switchOne/on -v 
```

**1/31/2024 Update!***

I finally got a chance to show my ✨ambient✨ teapot in action with Peter in Solo.io's weekly [Hoot webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa_1eRYdLDI)!
